# Alzheimer-s-Disease-Detection-via-Multiscale-Feature-Modelling

The prevalence of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) patients has significantly increased
recently, and early diagnosis is crucial. AI-aided solutions for diagnosing AD have been
increasing for decades. 
In this Model Two opensource datasets, OASIS and AD-Dataset are used to demonstrate extensive
experimentation and ablation study. The suggested model performs better than current
best practises, with accuracy values on OASIS and AD-Dataset of 99.75% and
96.20%, respectively. Additionally, a domain adaptation test was undertaken for this
work, and the results on the OASIS dataset yielded an acceptable accuracy of 83.25%
