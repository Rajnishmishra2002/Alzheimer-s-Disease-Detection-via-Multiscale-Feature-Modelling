# DeepAlz - AI-Powered Alzheimer's Detection
### ‚ÄúHarnessing Deep Learning to See the Unseen‚Äù


Welcome to DeepAlz, a research project born from a desire to tackle a critical real-world problem: the early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Existing diagnostic methods can be slow and subjective. This project explores how we can build a more robust, efficient, and highly accurate detection system using modern deep learning architectures.

This is more than just a classification model. It's an end-to-end investigation into efficient network design, novel attention mechanisms, and rigorous scientific validation, culminating in a model that achieves state-of-the-art results and is published in the *International Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems*.

### What This Project Does

*   **üß† High-Accuracy Diagnosis:** Accurately classifies brain MRI scans into four stages of Alzheimer's, achieving **99.75% accuracy** on the OASIS dataset and **96.25%** on the AD-Dataset.
*   **‚ú® Novel Attention Mechanism:** Introduces the **Improved Spatial Attention Block (I-SAB)**, a custom module designed to help the model focus more effectively on critical regions within MRI scans.
*   **‚ö° Computationally Efficient Design:** Built on a **Depth-Separable CNN** backbone, making the model significantly lighter and faster than traditional CNNs without sacrificing performance.
*   **üî¨ Published, Peer-Reviewed Research:** The methodology, results, and contributions of this project have been validated and published in a reputable scientific journal.

### Tech Stack

This project is built in Python 3 using the following core tools:

*   **TensorFlow & Keras** ‚Äì For building and training the deep learning model
*   **Scikit-learn** ‚Äì For performance metrics and model evaluation
*   **Pandas** ‚Äì For data manipulation and management
*   **Matplotlib & Seaborn** ‚Äì For data visualization and analyzing results
*   **NumPy** ‚Äì For fundamental numerical operations

### Features In Action: Classifying Alzheimer's Stages

The model is trained to identify and differentiate between four distinct classes from MRI scans:

1.  **Non-Demented** (Healthy)
2.  **Very Mild Demented**
3.  **Mild Demented**
4.  **Moderate Demented**

This multi-class capability is crucial for staging the disease, not just detecting its presence.

### Behind the Scenes: How It Works

1.  **Efficient Backbone (Depth-Separable CNNs):** Instead of using standard, computationally heavy convolutions, the model's architecture is based on depth-separable layers. This splits the convolution process into two steps (depthwise and pointwise), dramatically reducing the number of parameters and making the model faster to train.

2.  **Improved Spatial Attention (I-SAB):** This is the core innovation. Unlike standard attention blocks that only use max and average pooling, the I-SAB incorporates **three pooling strategies (max, average, and min)**. This gives the model a richer, more comprehensive understanding of the spatial features in an MRI, allowing it to better pinpoint subtle signs of disease.

3.  **Multi-Scale Feature Fusion:** The I-SAB modules are plugged into multiple layers of the CNN backbone (at the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th layers). This allows the model to capture disease-related features at different scales and levels of abstraction, from fine textures to broader structural changes.

4.  **Rigorous Validation:** The model wasn't just trained and tested. Its performance was confirmed through extensive **ablation studies** (testing the model with and without key components like the I-SAB) and **cross-dataset validation** to ensure its results are robust and generalizable.
